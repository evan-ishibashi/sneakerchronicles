      <p>Could this be the #1 Nike Collaboration of all time? Back in 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{color: 'blue', textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Bionicles</a> were the hottest toy on the market, so in typical Nike fashion, they had to do a sneaker collab together.</p>

      <p>Nike has always been king when it comes to attention to the details on their sneakers, so let's unpack what was featured on these shoes.</p>

      <p>Just like the toys were able to remove and swap their masks, the shoe can do the same thing with the removable toebox piece in the photo.</p>

      <p>I think my personal favorite part is the box itself. It's more of a bionicle branded box than it is Nike, and I think that's what makes it so special.</p>

      <p>The heel features a robotic rib-like cage look that replicates the Bionic characteristics of the toy, and just looks super clean on the shoe.</p>
